# Auxilium
An older version of the front-end prototype for a beginner-friendly developer community.
Please note that this is not the functional project, this is the draft version we created before fully integrating it with firebase. For simplicity and to prevent accidental charges, this is just a really messy demo to show what the front end would purely look like.
